I'm having trouble getting this test to report data.  I do see the PIDs when I look at agent runs so it appears things are working.  Just not seeing any data on the Overview graph, in Non-web or the Background jobs tab.

I've tried this with and without the decorator in the `test.py` file.  I've also tried adjusting the timeouts in the `newrelic_hooks_application_rq.py` file.
